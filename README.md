# Bayesian Statistics for Data Science
Instructor: Dr. Yuxiao Hung | https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuxiao-huang-a00b407a/

## COURSE DESCRIPTION:
This course is an introduction of Bayesian data analysis. Topics include parameter estimation (using formal analysis, grid approximation, and Markov chain Monte Carlo), hierarchical models, generalized linear models, JAGS, and Stan. Although lectures will include some theory, the emphasis of the course will be on programming these models in R, JAGS, and Stan, and applying the models to solve real-world problems. This computational aspect will differentiate this course significantly from the Statistics department’s course in Bayesian Methods (STAT 6223).

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
As a result of completing this course, students will be able to<br/>
• Use R, JAGS, and Stan to conduct Bayesian data analysis (parameter estimation, prediction,and model comparison).<br/>
• Evaluate Bayesian methods against other approaches on real-world data.<br/>
• Write technical report and present the results.<br/>
• Work both individually and as a team.<br/>
